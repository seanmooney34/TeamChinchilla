            <p>
                The MESA Community College Program supports students to successfully transfer to four-year universities in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) majors. This support is especially crucial to students who come from low-performing high schools.
                <br><br>
                The MESA Community College Program is a partnership between MESA and the <a href="extranet.cccco.edu/Divisions/AcademicAffairs/CurriculumandInstructionUnit/MathematicsEngineeringScienceAchievement.aspx">California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office.</a>

            <h4>Academic excellence workshops</h4>
            <p>
                Students are clustered in the same core math and science classes and taught how to deepen their understanding of complex key concepts and maintain high academic outcomes through group study techniques.
            </p>

            <h4>Orientation course</h4>
            <p>New students learn skills to excel as math, science and engineering majors.</p>

            <h4>Academic advising/counseling</h4>
            <p>Students receive individualized academic guidance and develop&nbsp;multi-year plans so they can take courses in the most effective sequence and transfer in a timely manner.</p>
